# Implementation Plan

## Timeline Overview
- Phase 1 (Project Setup & Data Layer): 1 week
- Phase 2 (Services & ViewModels): 1-2 weeks
- Phase 3 (UI Implementation): 1-2 weeks
- Phase 4 (Testing & Refinement): 1 week
- Phase 5 (Final Polish): 3-5 days
- Total Estimated Timeline: 5-7 weeks

## Development Approach
- **Dependencies**: Each phase requires the previous phase to be substantially complete (Phase 1 must complete before Phase 2, etc.)
- **Git Workflow**: Create feature branches for each phase (e.g., `feature/phase1-setup`, `feature/phase2-services`)
- **Testing**: Follow TDD approach - write tests alongside implementation
- **Risk Mitigation**: Conduct weekly check-ins after each phase completion
- **Extensibility**: Add code comments for future extensions in each component
- **Milestones**: End of Phase 5: Alpha build for internal review; End of Phase 8: Beta build for testing; End of Phase 9: Release candidate
